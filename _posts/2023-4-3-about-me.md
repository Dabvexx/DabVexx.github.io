# Intrest in Art

Recently, I have gathered an intrest in visual arts. I know a good amount of 3D modeling techniques and I have been practicing 2D illustrations. I have bought a Huion Kamvas 16 Pro to get serious in digital art, and I carry a sketchbook in my bag that I take with me most everywhere I go.
