# Education

I am currently working on my degree from SUNY Morrisville that will finish in 2025. All that is left is for me to do my intenship. I am very good at teaching myself how to learn, I started programming on my own using scratch, and eventually learned C# and Unity by looking at documentation and articles online. If it wern't for the skills I bn got from teaching myself I could never have gotten as far as I am as a programmer.

# Skills

I am proficient in C# and Unity. I have dipped my toes in other C languages (see [this post]() to read about my C++ OpenGL renderer!) C# is what really taught me to program beyond simple toy programs. 

I also like experimenting with blender to learn how better to use it. check [this post](_posts\2024-9-9-DungeonModel.md) for a scene of a dungeon, and [this post]() to see my first ever rigged model!
