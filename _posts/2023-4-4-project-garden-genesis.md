# What is Garden Genesis: The Art of Cultivation?

"Garden Genesis: The Art of Cultivation", or simply Garden Genesis as I shall refer to it for the rest of this blog, is the submission me and a few of my friends created for Global Game Jam '23. The theme for this game jam was "Roots", which could be interperated as many different things. A few projects I saw while playing a few of the game from the jam had the idea of family heritige, the creation of culture, and plants.

My immediate idea for this theme was a type of botony plant breeding sim in which you breed plants together, which will then combine attributes of the parent plants, such as color and flower shape, and produce an entirely new plant. 

An interesting point about this game is the opening cutscene. The opening cutscene story and voice over was entirely created by AI. [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) wrote the story based on a few prompts (It even generated the name itself from combining 2 of its responses). [ElevenLabs](https://beta.elevenlabs.io) voice replicating AI did the dramatic reading.
